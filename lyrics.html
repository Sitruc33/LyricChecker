[Verse 2]<br>
I'm thinkin' colossal<br>
I'm thinkin' 'bout flyin' the vibes out, goin' tropical<br>
I know I'm impeccable<br>
Seen what these niggas can do when that shit get federal<br>
Caught in between, eatin' up a queen<br>
Eatin' up a bean like vegetables<br>
Step out on the scene livin' like a king<br>
I know this game can be treacherous<br>

And now it's tangible</a><br>
Tell me how you get this comfortable<br>
You're wearin' a wild animal<br>
