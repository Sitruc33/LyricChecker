This is my first real experience with node and express and there will be more updates to include a way to input keywords and get rid of the need to refresh the page to see updated results. 
For now you can just change the keywords you want to search for by editing the set in apiCall. Not ideal but this was made as a personal project and I just wanted to make sure the song was work friendly
